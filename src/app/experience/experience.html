                    Currently working as a Software Developer for a major automotive client. My role involves developing
                    new features, enhancing existing modules, and ensuring smooth integration between various
                    applications within the system landscape. I collaborate closely with cross-functional teams to
                    understand requirements, implement solutions, and resolve production issues efficiently.
                    Additionally, I am responsible for improving code quality, optimizing performance, and contributing
                    to discussions on technical approaches and best practices to support business objectives.
